# Audio File formats

### \* .mp3

**lossy** compression format means it compresses the data in such a way that during the proccessing of that data we can lose information.

### \* .flac

this is a **loss-less** compression format means it uses an algorithm to shrink the data without losing any important data. Essentially, it rewrites the file to make it more efficient - resulting in a smaller storage or transfer size.

### \* .wav

It is an uncompressed format. So, here we have best quality of audio data but the file size is the largest here.

> working with .wav files is the easiest

## Audio signal parameteres

- _number of channels_ => it may be '1' or '2'. 1 is mono and 2 is stereo. means number of independent audio channel
- _sample width_
- _framerate/sample_rate_ => number of samples for each second. e.g. 44.1 KHz means 44100 samples in One second
- _number of frame_ => total number of frame we
- _values of a frame_
