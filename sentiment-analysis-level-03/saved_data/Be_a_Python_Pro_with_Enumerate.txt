Do you code in Python? If you don't do this one thing, it's a dead giveaway that you're a complete noob. It's super common in code to want to iterate over a list of things. And in Python, that's really easy with a for loop. But what if when iterating you want to keep the index location of each item, one way is to iterate over a range with the length of your list. This works. But if you do it, you're a certified noob. Another way to do this is to create a counter, which you can increment every time you iterate over an item in your loop. This also works. But if you do it, you're a certified double NU. So how do you do it? You Ask. Quit your wanting. I'm about to show you. We can use the built in Python function enumerate. Now, when we loop over our enumerated list, we get both the index and the item in the list. Not only will this make your code cleaner, but it will show that you're a certified Python pro.
